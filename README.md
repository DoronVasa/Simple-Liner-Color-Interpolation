This is a quick program that uses Pygame to visualize linear color interpolation between two RGB values.

To run this yourself, make sure you have Pygame installed. If you donâ€™t, simply run the following command in your command prompt:
pip install pygame

I was creating a color-switching background in C# for my Unity game, and I got sucked into a rabbit hole of color interpolation and extrapolation. This inspired me to make this quick Python script with the help of the top comment on this Stack Overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21835739/smooth-color-transition-algorithm.
